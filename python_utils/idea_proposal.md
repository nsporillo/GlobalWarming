# IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SOIL FUNCTIONS
The impact of climate change on soils is a slow complex process as because soils not only be strongly affected by climate change directly (for example effect of temperature on soil organic matter decomposition and indirectly, for example changes in soil moisture via changes in plant related evapotranspiration) but also can act as a source of greenhouse gases and thus contribute to the gases responsible for climate change. In addition changes in the functions and uses soils may be driven more by socio-economic factors than environmental ones.<br />

## Direct impacts of climate change on soil functions:
Soil-climate models assuming constant inputs of carbon to soils from vegetation predicts the expected changes in temperature, precipitation and evaporation with a concomitant increase in organic matter turnover facilitating increased losses of CO2 in mineral and organic soils. These losses of soil carbon will also affect other soil functions like poorer soil structure, stability, topsoil [water holding capacity behaviour](https://github.com/ojhaanshu87/GlobalWarming/blob/soil_type_impact_on_global_warming/python_utils/water_holding_capacity_behaviour.md), nutrient availability and erosion. <br />

## Indirect impacts of climate change on soil functions:
 The integrated impact of climate change is expected to generally increase crop yields (with winter wheat, sunflower and sugar beet) as a result of the combined effects of CO2 fertilisation, radiation use efficiency and longer growing seasons which mostly applies to species with the C3 photosynthetic pathway22,23 and not necessarily to species with the C4 pathway.</br>
